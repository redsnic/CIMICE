Description: 
    CIMICE is a tool in the field of tumor phylogenetics and
    its goal is to build a Markov Chain (called Cancer Progression Markov Chain,
    CPMC) in order to model tumor subtypes evolution.
    The input of CIMICE is a Mutational Matrix, so a boolean matrix representing
    altered genes in a collection of samples. These samples are assumed to be
    obtained with single-cell DNA analysis techniques and the tool is 
    specifically written to use the peculiarities of this data for the CMPC
    construction.
